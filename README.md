# BOWShips: build your own warships

This project started after yet another session of complaining about the venerable Springsharp and its limitations. The goal is to provide a fantasy warship designer that is tweakable, multiplatform and has a modern open-source codebase.

## milestones/roadmap
- (WIP) first working prototype: speed and power
- adding armour calculations
- adding guns & turrets
- adding everything else

## Contributors
- Jonas 'Trifonius' Vermassen (me!): main programming
- discord user Bob1234567890987654321: Speed-to-Power calculations (implementing Holtrop-Mennen)
