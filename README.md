# BOWShips: build your own warships

This project started after yet another session of complaining about the venerable Springsharp and its limitations. The goal is to provide a fantasy warship designer that is tweakable, multiplatform and has a modern open-source codebase.

## milestones/roadmap
- first working prototype: speed and power
- adding armour calculations
- adding guns & turrets (WIP)
- adding freeboard
- adding comp
- adding misc weapons
- adding reporting
- ...
